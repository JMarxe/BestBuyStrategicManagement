<h1>Recommendations:</h1>

As mentioned in the potential thread, the Online retailers are a considered thread for Best Buy; that's why BestBuy should adopt a Hybrid Strategy to be able to sell online via their website as well as the physical store for the other type of clients; this strategy has been proven to work by Walmart as their sell products simultaneously by the physical stores and also in Walmart.com website.

To solve the profitability of the Business Model, BestBuy should take advantage of having loyalty and a huge amount customer to incorporate into their catalog of products, their own brand of electronics, being able to earn profit-making a direct sell, without them being the middleman between the brands and the consumers. Netflix implemented this strategy as they began having a catalog of well-known third-party movies, and then they incorporated their own products into their catalog and slowly increasing the percentage between Netflix Creations and third-party productions.

Cash Liquidity Issues are a big problem for BestBuy; that's why; together with the previous strategy mentioned; they should decrease the number of products of the big and expensive brands that don't have a good profit margin (Apple, Samsung, etc.) and start working with brands that are more competitive in terms of prices and that have the same quality of not better such as Xiaomi, Huawei, OPPO, VIVO, Realme, etc.
